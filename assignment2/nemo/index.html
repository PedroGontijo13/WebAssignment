          <b class="b-orange-bg">Finding Nemo</b> is the best-selling DVD title
          of all time, with over 40 million copies sold as of 2006, and was the
          highest-grossing G-rated film of all time before Pixar's own Toy Story
          3 overtook it. The film was re-released in 3D in 2012. In 2008, the
          American film Institute named it as the 10th greatest American
          animated film as part of their 10 Top 10 lists. A sequel, Finding
          <span class="dory">Dory</span>, was released in June 2016.ome time
          later, Marlin is overprotective of <b class="b-orange-bg">Nemo</b>,
          born with a stunted right fin. On <b class="b-orange-bg">Nemo</b>'s
          first day of school, Marlin embarrasses
          <b class="b-orange-bg">Nemo</b>, and the two argue. While Marlin is
          talking to <b class="b-orange-bg">Nemo</b>'s teacher,
          <b class="b-orange-bg">Nemo</b> defiantly approaches a nearby
          speedboat, where a pair of scuba divers capture him. Marlin pursues
          the boat in vain and meets <span class="dory">Dory</span>, a blue tang
          with acute short-term memory loss, who offers her help. The two
          encounter Bruce, Anchor, and Chum, three sharks who have sworn to
          abstain from eating fish. Marlin discovers a diver's mask that fell
          from the boat; he accidentally hits
          <span class="dory">Dory</span> with it, giving her a nosebleed. The
          scent sends Bruce into a feeding frenzy, but they flee after
          accidentally setting off a ring of old naval mines, which knock Marlin
          and <span class="dory">Dory</span> unconscious.
          <b class="b-orange-bg">Nemo</b> is placed in an aquarium in the office
          of dentist Philip Sherman in Sydney, Australia. He meets the "Tank
          Gang", including yellow tang Bubbles, starfish Peach, cleaner shrimp
          Jacques, blowfish Bloat, royal gramma Gurgle, and twin damselfish Deb
          and Flo, led by Gill, a Moorish idol.
          <b class="b-orange-bg">Nemo</b> learns he is to be given to Sherman's
          young niece, Darla, who has killed her previous fish. Gill devises a
          risky escape plan: <b class="b-orange-bg">Nemo</b>, who can fit inside
          the aquarium's filter tube, will jam the filter with a pebble, forcing
          Sherman to put the fish into plastic bags while he cleans the tank,
          allowing them to roll out the window and into the harbor.
          <b class="b-orange-bg">Nemo</b> attempts the maneuver, but fails and
          is almost killed. Marlin and <span class="dory">Dory</span> wake up
          unharmed, but the mask falls into a deep trench. They descend after it
          and encounter an anglerfish that chases them.
          <span class="dory">Dory</span> memorizes the address written on the
          goggles, and they escape. <span class="dory">Dory</span> and Marlin
          receive directions from a school of moonfish, but Marlin disregards
          them to take what he believes is a safer route. They stumble into a
          forest of jellyfish, the stings of which knock them unconscious. They
          awaken in the East Australian Current with a group of sea turtles,
          including Crush and his son, Squirt. Marlin tells them about his
          quest, and the story is relayed across the ocean to Sydney, where a
          pelican, Nigel, tells the Tank Gang. Inspired by his father's bravery,
          <b class="b-orange-bg">Nemo</b> makes another attempt to jam the
          filter and succeeds, and soon the aquarium is covered in green algae.

          The inspiration for <b class="b-orange-bg">Finding Nemo</b> sprang from multiple experiences,
          going back to director <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0004056/">Andrew Stanton</a>'s childhood, when he loved going
          to the dentist to see the fish tank, assuming that the fish were from
          the ocean and wanted to go home. In 1992, shortly after his son was
          born, he and his family took a trip to Six Flags Discovery Kingdom
          (which was called Marine World at the time). There, after seeing the
          shark tube and various exhibits, he felt that the underwater world
          could be done beautifully in computer animation. Later, in 1997, he
          took his son for a walk in the park but realized that he was
          overprotecting him and lost an opportunity to have a father-son
          experience that day.
