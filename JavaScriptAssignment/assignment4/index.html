          <p>
            Night (also described as night time, unconventionally spelled as
            "nite") is the period of ambient darkness from sunset to sunrise
            during each 24-hour day, when the Sun is below the horizon. The
            exact time when night begins and ends depends on the location and
            varies throughout the year, based on factors such as season and
            latitude.

          <h2 class="title">Lightning</h2>
          <p>
            Lightning is a naturally occurring electrostatic discharge during
            which two electrically charged regions, both in the atmosphere or
            with one on the ground, temporarily neutralize themselves, causing
            the instantaneous release of an average of one gigajoule of energy.
            This discharge may produce a wide range of electromagnetic
            radiation, from heat created by the rapid movement of electrons, to
            brilliant flashes of visible light in the form of black-body
            radiation. Lightning causes thunder, a sound from the shock wave
            which develops as gases in the vicinity of the discharge experience
            a sudden increase in pressure. Lightning occurs commonly during
            thunderstorms as well as other types of energetic weather systems,
            but volcanic lightning can also occur during volcanic eruptions.

          <h2 class="title">Party Cloudy</h2>
          <p>
            In meteorology, a cloud is an aerosol consisting of a visible mass
            of miniature liquid droplets, frozen crystals, or other particles
            suspended in the atmosphere of a planetary body or similar space.
            Water or various other chemicals may compose the droplets and
            crystals. On Earth, clouds are formed as a result of saturation of
            the air when it is cooled to its dew point, or when it gains
            sufficient moisture (usually in the form of water vapor) from an
            adjacent source to raise the dew point to the ambient temperature.

          <h2 class="title">Haze</h2>
          <p>
            Haze is traditionally an atmospheric phenomenon in which dust,
            smoke, and other dry particulates suspended in air obscure
            visibility and the clarity of the sky. The World Meteorological
            Organization manual of codes includes a classification of
            particulates causing horizontal obscuration into categories of fog,
            ice fog, steam fog, mist, haze, smoke, volcanic ash, dust, sand, and
            snow. Sources for particles that cause haze include farming
            (ploughing in dry weather), traffic, industry, volcanic activity and
            wildfires. Seen from afar (e.g. an approaching airplane) and
            depending on the direction of view with respect to the Sun, haze may
            appear brownish or bluish, while mist tends to be bluish grey
            instead. Whereas haze often is thought of as a phenomenon occurring
            in dry air, mist formation is a phenomenon in saturated, humid air.
            However, haze particles may act as condensation nuclei that leads to
            the subsequent vapor condensation and formation of mist droplets;
            such forms of haze are known as "wet haze."

          <h2 class="title">Sunset</h2>
          <p>
            Sunset, also known as sundown, is the daily disappearance of the Sun
            below the horizon due to Earth's rotation. As viewed from everywhere
            on Earth (except the North and South poles), the equinox Sun sets
            due west at the moment of both the Spring and Autumn equinox. As
            viewed from the Northern Hemisphere, the sun sets to the northwest
            (or not at all) in the Northern hemisphere's spring and summer, and
            to the southwest in the autumn and winter; these seasons are
            reversed for the Southern Hemisphere.

          <h2 class="title">Wind</h2>
          <p>
            Wind is the natural movement of air or other gases relative to a
            planet's surface. Winds occur on a range of scales, from
            thunderstorm flows lasting tens of minutes, to local breezes
            generated by heating of land surfaces and lasting a few hours, to
            global winds resulting from the difference in absorption of solar
            energy between the climate zones on Earth. The two main causes of
            large-scale atmospheric circulation are the differential heating
            between the equator and the poles, and the rotation of the planet
            (Coriolis effect). Within the tropics and subtropics, thermal low
            circulations over terrain and high plateaus can drive monsoon
            circulations. In coastal areas the sea breeze/land breeze cycle can
            define local winds; in areas that have variable terrain, mountain
            and valley breezes can prevail.

            Snow clouds usually occur in the context of larger weather systems,
            the most important of which is the low-pressure area, which
            typically incorporate warm and cold fronts as part of their
            circulation. Two additional and locally productive sources of snow
            are lake-effect (also sea-effect) storms and elevation effects,
            especially in mountains.

          <h2 class="title">Mountain effects</h2>
          <p>
            Orographic or relief snowfall is created when moist air is forced up
            the windward side of mountain ranges by a large-scale wind flow. The
            lifting of moist air up the side of a mountain range results in
            adiabatic cooling, and ultimately condensation and precipitation.
            Moisture is gradually removed from the air by this process, leaving
            drier and warmer air on the descending, or leeward, side. The
            resulting enhanced snowfall, along with the decrease in temperature
            with elevation, combine to increase snow depth and seasonal
            persistence of snowpack in snow-prone areas.
