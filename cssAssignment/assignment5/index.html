          Canada's cities and towns offer travelers a diverse choice of
          experiences, from chic, cosmopolitan centers to mountain resorts and
          maritime cities. Determining the best places to visit may depend on
          your interests and the type of trip you're hoping to create.

          In the heart of the country is Toronto, Canada's biggest city and the
          highlight of Canada's arts and cultural scene. Nearby, Niagara Falls
          is a must-see attraction for visitors to Canada that never
          disappoints. In the neighboring French-speaking province of Québec,
          Montreal is known for fashion, culture, and history.
          <br />
          In the West, Vancouver and Victoria offer two very different
          perspectives on West Coast cities, but each has something unique to
          offer. The mountain towns of Whistler and Banff are places to immerse
          yourself in beautiful mountain scenery and enjoy a little of the great
          outdoors.

          Vancouver is a major city in western Canada, located in the Lower
          Mainland region of British Columbia. As the most populous city in the
          province, the 2021 census recorded 662,248 people in the city, up from
          631,486 in 2016. The Greater Vancouver area had a population of 2.6
          million in 2021, making it the third-largest metropolitan area in
          Canada. Vancouver has the highest population density in Canada, with
          over 5,700 people per square kilometre. Vancouver is one of the most
          ethnically and linguistically diverse cities in Canada: 46 percent of
          its residents are not native English speakers, 44 percent are native
          speakers of neither English nor French, and 51.6 percent of residents
          belong to visible minority groups. <br />
          Vancouver is one of the most livable cities in Canada and in the
          world. In terms of housing affordability, Vancouver is also one of the
          most expensive cities in Canada and in the world. Vancouver plans to
          become the greenest city in the world. Vancouverism is the city's
          urban planning design philosophy. <br />
          Vancouver has hosted many international conferences and events,
          including the 1954 Commonwealth Games, UN Habitat I, Expo 86, APEC
          Canada 1997, the World Police and Fire Games in 1989 and 2009; several
          matches of 2015 FIFA Women's World Cup including the finals at BC
          Place in Downtown Vancouver, and the 2010 Winter Olympics and
          Paralympics which were held in Vancouver and Whistler, a resort
          community 125 km (78 mi) north of the city. In 1969, Greenpeace was
          founded in Vancouver. The city became the permanent home to TED

          Canada's most famous natural attraction, the majestic Niagara Falls
          has been drawing sightseers almost since its discovery. The great wall
          of water pounding over the falls is an amazing sight, and the view and
          access afforded visitors is astounding. You can literally walk up to
          the edge of the falls, separated only by a cast iron railing, and see
          the water as it disappears over the crest. <br />
          In 2021, the Niagara Parks Commission opened the 115-year-old Canadian
          Niagara Power Company generating station. After years of painstaking
          renovations and rehabilitation, this fascinating building displays its
          old generators and electrical equipment. The plan is to allow visitors
          to descend beneath the building and walk through former water tunnels,
          ending up at the river's edge below the falls. <br />
          The city that has developed here, also named Niagara Falls, has been
          greatly influenced by the people and atmosphere the falls have
          created. Stuntmen and daredevils have been tempting their fate on the
          falls throughout the decades, and as a result, a carnival-style
          atmosphere has come to define this unique city. Just a short drive
          from Toronto, Niagara Falls is easy to reach, and the city is a fun
          place to spend a day or two. conferences in 2014.

          Toronto is the capital city of the Canadian province of Ontario. With
          a recorded population of 2,794,356 in 2021, it is the most populous
          city in Canada and the fourth most populous city in North America. The
          city is the anchor of the Golden Horseshoe, an urban agglomeration of
          9,765,188 people (as of 2021) surrounding the western end of Lake
          Ontario, while the Greater Toronto Area proper had a 2021 population
          of 6,712,341. Toronto is an international centre of business, finance,
          arts, sports and culture, and is recognized as one of the most
          multicultural and cosmopolitan cities in the world. <br />
          Indigenous peoples have travelled through and inhabited the Toronto
          area, located on a broad sloping plateau interspersed with rivers,
          deep ravines, and urban forest, for more than 10,000 years. After the
          broadly disputed Toronto Purchase, when the Mississauga surrendered
          the area to the British Crown, the British established the town of
          York in 1793 and later designated it as the capital of Upper Canada.
          During the War of 1812, the town was the site of the Battle of York
          and suffered heavy damage by American troops. York was renamed and
          incorporated in 1834 as the city of Toronto. It was designated as the
          capital of the province of Ontario in 1867 during Canadian
          Confederation.The city proper has since expanded past its original
          limits through both annexation and amalgamation to its current area of
          630.2 km2 (243.3 sq mi). <br />
          The diverse population of Toronto reflects its current and historical
          role as an important destination for immigrants to Canada. More than
          50 percent of residents belong to a visible minority population group,
          and over 200 distinct ethnic origins are represented among its
          inhabitants. While the majority of Torontonians speak English as their
          primary language, over 160 languages are spoken in the city. The mayor
          of Toronto is elected by direct popular vote to serve as the chief
          executive of the city. The Toronto City Council is a unicameral
          legislative body, comprising 25 councillors since the 2018 municipal
          election, representing geographical wards throughout the city.

          dating back to the 1600s and a modern city center with extensive

          Montreal is also home to a large number of fashion designers, and
          high-end boutiques line the historic streets, along with quaint hotels
          and restaurants. Located in the French- speaking province of Québec,
          Montreal has its own cultural identity, but English-speaking visitors
