          <p>
            A Watch is a portable timepiece intended to be carried or worn by a
            person. It is designed to keep a consistent movement despite the
            motions caused by the person's activities. A wristwatch is designed
            to be worn around the wrist, attached by a Watch strap or other type
            of bracelet, including metal bands, leather straps or any other kind
            of bracelet. A pocket Watch is designed for a person to carry in a
            pocket, often attached to a chain. Watches were developed in the
            17th century from spring-powered clocks, which appeared as early as
            the 14th century. During most of its history the Watch was a
            mechanical device, driven by clockwork, powered by winding a
            mainspring, and keeping Time with an oscillating balance wheel.
            These are called mechanical watches. In the 1960s the electronic
            quartz Watch was invented, which was powered by a battery and kept
            Time with a vibrating quartz crystal. By the 1980s the quartz Watch
            had taken over most of the market from the mechanical watch.
            Historically, this is called the quartz revolution (also known as
            quartz crisis in Switzerland). Developments the 2010s include
            smartwatches, which are elaborate computer-like electronic devices
            designed to be worn on a wrist. They generally incorporate
            timekeeping functions, but these are only a small subset of the
            smartwatch's facilities.

          <h1>History</h1>
          <p>
            Watches evolved from portable spring-driven clocks, which first
            appeared in 15th-century Europe. Watches were not widely worn in
            pockets until the 17th century. One account suggests that the word
            "watch" came from the Old English word woecce - which meant
            "watchman" because town watchmen used the technology to keep track
            of their shifts at work. Another says that the term came from
            17th-century sailors, who used the new mechanisms to Time the length
            of their shipboard watches (duty shifts).

          Electronic watches require electricity as a power source, and some
          mechanical movements and hybrid electronic-mechanical movements also
          require electricity. Usually, the electricity is provided by a
          replaceable battery. The first use of electrical power in watches was
          as a substitute for the mainspring, to remove the need for winding.
          The first electrically powered watch, the Hamilton Electric 500, was
          released in 1957 by the Hamilton Watch Company of Lancaster,
          Pennsylvania.

          <h1>Evolution</h1>
          <p>
            A rise in accuracy occurred in 1657 with the addition of the balance
            spring to the balance wheel, an invention disputed both at the Time
            and ever since between Robert Hooke and Christiaan Huygens. This
            innovation increased watches' accuracy enormously, reducing error
            from perhaps several hours per day to perhaps 10 minutes per
            day,[18] resulting in the addition of the minute hand to the face
            from around 1680 in Britain and around 1700 in France. The increased
            accuracy of the balance wheel focused attention on errors caused by
            other parts of the movement, igniting a two-century wave of
            watchmaking innovation. The first thing to be improved was the
            escapement. The verge escapement was replaced in quality watches by
            the cylinder escapement, invented by Thomas Tompion in 1695 and
            further developed by George Graham in the 1720s. Improvements in
            manufacturing such as the tooth-cutting machine devised by Robert
            Hooke allowed some increase in the volume of Watch production,
            although finishing and assembling was still done by hand until well
            into the 19th century.

        <p>
          Conversions between atomic Time systems (TAI, GPS, and UTC) are for
          the most part exact. However, GPS Time is a measured value as opposed
          to a computed "paper" scale. As such it may differ from UTC(USNO) by a
          few hundred nanoseconds,which in turn may differ from official UTC by
          as much as 26 nanoseconds. Conversions for UT1 and TT rely on
          published difference tables which as of 2022 are specified to 10
          microseconds and 0.1 nanoseconds respectively.
