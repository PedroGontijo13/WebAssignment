              <a>Woody</a> is the same pull-string cowboy sheriff that
              <a>Andy</a> fell in love with years ago. Heâ€™s found a new home
              with Bonnie and her toys, and heâ€™ll do anything to make sure
              sheâ€™s happy and theyâ€™re all taken care of. But an unexpected
              reunion with his dear friend <a>Bo Peep</a> shows Woody that the
              world is much bigger than he ever imagined.

              <a>Buzz Lightyear</a> is loyal not only to his owner, but to the
              friends heâ€™s made along the wayâ€”especially his once-rival
              Woody whoâ€™s like a brother to the ace Space Ranger these days.
              Buzz would do anything to support his pull-string buddy, but when
              his efforts land him in a carnival game booth as an inadvertent
              prize, he turns to his inner voice for guidance. This is an
              intergalactic emergency.

              <a>Bo Peep</a> is a long-lost friend of <a>Woody</a>,
              <a>Buzz</a> and the gang, who always shared a special connection
              with Woody while residing with her sheep on a lamp base at
              <a>Andy</a>â€™s house. After being separated for years, Bo has
              become chipped and discarded, but her spirit is far from broken.
              She has grown into an adventure-seeking free spirit whose strength
              and sarcasm belie her delicate porcelain exterior. Open your eyes,
              Woody. There's plenty of kids out there. Sometimes change can be
              good!
