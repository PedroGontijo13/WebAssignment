              A <a href="#">lightsaber</a> is a fictional energy sword featured
              throughout the <b class="star-wars">Star Wars</b> franchise. A
              typical <a href="#">lightsaber</a> is depicted as a luminescent
              plasma blade about 3 feet (0.91 m) in length emitted from a metal
              hilt around 10.5 inches (27 cm) in length.[1] First introduced in
              the original <b class="star-wars">Star Wars</b> film,[a] it has
              since appeared in most <b class="star-wars">Star Wars</b> films,
              with at least one <a href="#">lightsaber</a>
              duel occurring in each installment of the "Skywalker saga". The
              <a href="#">lightsaber</a>'s distinct appearance was created using
              rotoscoping for the original films, and with digital effects for
              the prequel and sequel trilogies.

              As presented in the films, a <a href="#">lightsaber</a>'s energy
              blade can cut, burn, and melt through most substances with little
              resistance.[4] It leaves cauterized wounds in flesh, but can be
              deflected by another blade, by energy shields,
              <a href="#">lightsaber</a> or by the metal beskar. The blade has
              even been used as a tool to weld metal. Other times, the
              <a href="#">lightsaber</a> has been shown to cause bleeding wounds
              in the flesh, sometimes accompanied by burns. Some exotic
              saber-proof melee weapons have been introduced in the Expanded
              Universe as well as later episodic films. An active
              <a href="#">lightsaber</a> gives off a distinctive hum, which
              rises in pitch and volume as the blade is moved rapidly through
              the air. Bringing the blade into contact with another
              <a href="#">lightsaber</a>'s blade produces a loud crackle.

              For the original <b class="star-wars">Star Wars</b> film, the film
              prop hilts were constructed by John Stears from old Graflex press
              camera flash battery packs and other pieces of hardware. The
              full-sized sword props were designed to appear ignited onscreen,
              by later creating an "in-camera" glowing effect in
              post-production. The blade is a three-sided rod which was coated
              with a Scotchlite retroreflector array, the same sort used for
              highway signs.[14] A lamp was positioned to the side of the taking
              camera and reflected towards the subject through 45-degree angled
              glass so that the sword would appear to glow from the camera's
              point of view.

              Set decorator Roger Christian found the handles for the Graflex
              Flash Gun in a photography shop in Great Marlborough Street, in
              London's West End.[15] He then added cabinet T-track to the
              handles, securely attaching them with cyanoacrylate glue. Adding a
              few "greebles" (surface details), Christian managed to hand-make
              the first prototype of a <a href="#">lightsaber</a> prop for Luke
              before production began. George Lucas decided he wanted to add a
              clip to the handle, so that Luke could hang it on his belt.
              <span class="blue-p">
                When all was said and done, Lucas and Spielberg returned the
                1970s audience, grown sophisticated on a diet of European and
                New Hollywood films, to the simplicities of the pre-1960s Golden
                Age of movies... They marched backward through the
                looking-glass.</span
              >
              Once Lucas felt the handle was up to his standards, it went to
              John Stears to create the wooden dowel rod with front-projection
              paint so that the animators would have a glow of light to enhance
              later on in post production. Due to lack of preparation time,
              Christian's prototype and a second spare were used for the
              shooting in Tunisia, where filming on Star Wars began.[16] It was
              discovered, however, that the glowing effect was greatly dependent
              on the rod's orientation to the camera, and during the Obi-Wan
              Kenobi/Darth Vader duel, they could clearly be seen as rods.
              Because of this, the glow would be added in post-production
              through rotoscoping, which also allowed for diffusion to be
              employed to enhance the glow.

              Korean animator Nelson Shin, who was working for DePatieâ€“Freleng
              Enterprises at the time, was asked by his manager if he could
              animate the <a href="#">lightsaber</a> in the live-action scenes
              of a film. After Shin accepted the assignment, the live-action
              footage was given to him. He drew the <a href="#">lightsaber</a>s
              with a rotoscope, an animation which was superimposed onto the
              footage of the physical <a href="#">lightsaber</a> blade prop.
              Shin explained to the people from Lucasfilm that since a
              <a href="#">lightsaber</a> is made of light, the sword should look
              "a little shaky" like a fluorescent tube. He suggested inserting
              one frame that was much lighter than the others while printing the
              film on an optical printer, making the light seem to vibrate. Shin
              also recommended adding a degausser sound on top of the other
              sounds for the weapon since the sound would be reminiscent of a
              magnetic field. The whole process took one week, surprising his
              company. Lucasfilm showed Shin the finished product, having
              followed his suggestions to use an X-Acto knife to give the
              <a href="#">lightsaber</a> a very sharp look, and to have sound
              accompany the weapon's movements.

              <a href="#">lightsaber</a>s were present in the earliest drafts as
              mundane plasma weapons that were used alongside laser
              guns.[21][22] The introduction of the Force in a later revision
              made the Jedi and the Sith supernaturally skilled; initially they
              were only portrayed as swordsmen.[23] The
              <a href="#">lightsaber</a> became the Force-user's tool, described
              in A New Hope by Obi-Wan Kenobi as "not as clumsy or random as a
              blaster. An elegant weapon, for a more civilized age."[24] The
              source of a <a href="#">lightsaber</a>'s power is a kyber
              crystal.[25] These crystals are also the power source of the Death
              Star's superlaser.

              Since the release of the first film, replicas of
              <a href="#">lightsaber</a>s have been a popular piece of Star Wars
              merchandise, ranging from inexpensive plastic toys to the "Force
              FX" series from Master Replicas, deluxe replicas which use
              LED-lighted tubes and sound effects to create a close audio-visual
              representation of what is seen on screen.Disneyland in California
              sells <a href="#">lightsaber</a>-themed churros outside its Star
              Tours attraction.[45] Disneyland and Disney World (Hollywood
              Studios) also sell legacy <a href="#">lightsaber</a>s which are
              replicas of the <a href="#">lightsaber</a> seen used by the Jedi
              and Sith in the movies such as Darth Vader, Obi-Wan Kenobi, Rey
              Skywalker, Count Dooku, and Kylo Ren.[46][47] Disneyland and
              Hollywood Studios also offer Savi's Workshop, a place where guests
              can build their own <a href="#">lightsaber</a> and choose their
              own kyber crystal, thereby changing the blade color of their own
              unique <a href="#">lightsaber</a>.[48][49][50] Besides Savi's
              Workshop, there is another custom
              <a href="#">lightsaber</a> experience. The Star Trader at
              Disneyland offers guests a chance to build their own
              <a href="#">lightsaber</a>, without first paying 200 dollars for
              the experience.

              With the advent of motion-controlled video games, players were
              given the opportunity to wield an in-game <a href="#">lightsaber</a> with their
              own hands. In the seventh generation of video game consoles, there
              were several <b class="star-wars">Star Wars</b> video games available on the Wii (Lego Star
              Wars: The Complete Saga, <b class="star-wars">Star Wars</b>: The Force Unleashed, Star
              Wars: The Clone Wars â€“ <a href="#">lightsaber</a> Duels, <b class="star-wars">Star Wars</b>: The Clone
              Wars â€“ Republic Heroes and Lego <b class="star-wars">Star Wars</b> III: The Clone Wars)
              and one on the Xbox 360 (Kinect <b class="star-wars">Star Wars</b>) that utilized motion
              controls to wield a <a href="#">lightsaber</a> through arm gestures. Unleashed and
              Duels, both developed by Krome Studios, have more precise control
              of the <a href="#">lightsaber</a>, allowing players to swing it in any of five
              different directions (up, down, left, right or forward) with the
              Wii Remote, while Kinect takes advantage of the eponymous,
              camera-based motion controller to grant the player a more fluid,
              one-to-one control method of swinging the <a href="#">lightsaber</a>.
