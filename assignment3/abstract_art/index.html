              the 19th century, underpinned by the logic of perspective and an
              attempt to reproduce an illusion of visible reality. By the end of
              the 19th century many
              <span style="text-decoration: underline">art</span>ists felt a

              changes taking place in technology, science and philosophy. The
              sources from which individualists drew their theoretical arguments
              were diverse, and reflected the social and intellectual
              preoccupations in all areas of Western culture at that time.

                Patronage from the church diminished and private patronage from
                the public became more capable of providing a livelihood for
                artists.[12][13] Three
                <span style="text-decoration: underline">art</span> movements
                which contributed to the development of
                <span class="back-3"> <b>Abstract</b></span>
                <span style="text-decoration: underline">art</span> were
                Romanticism, Impressionism and Expressionism. Artistic
                independence for artists was advanced during the 19th century.
                An objective interest in what is seen, can be discerned from the
                paintings of John Constable, J M W Turner, Camille Corot and
                from them to the Impressionists who continued the plein air
                painting of the Barbizon school.

                Early intimations of a new
                <span style="text-decoration: underline">art</span> had been
                made by James McNeill Whistler who, in his painting Nocturne in
                Black and Gold: The falling Rocket, (1872), placed greater
                emphasis on visual sensation than the depiction of objects. Even

                In Chinese painting, <span class="back-3"> <b>Abstract</b></span
                >ion can be traced to the Tang dynasty painter Wang Mo (çŽ‹å¢¨),
                who is credited to have invented the splashed-ink painting
                style.[8] While none of his paintings remain, this style is
                clearly seen in some Song Dynasty Paintings. The Chan buddhist
                painter Liang Kai (æ¢æ¥·, c. 1140â€“1210) applied the style to
                figure painting in his "Immortal in splashed ink" in which
                accurate representation is sacrificed to enhance spontaneity
                linked to the non-rational mind of the enlightened.
                <span style="background-color: rgb(27, 144, 122)">
                  A late Song painter named Yu Jian, adept to Tiantai buddhism,
                  created a series of splashed ink landscapes that eventually
                  inspired many Japanese Zen painters. His paintings show
                  heavily misty mountains in which the shapes of the objects are
                  barely visible and extremely simplified. This type of painting
                  was continued by Sesshu Toyo in his later years.</span
