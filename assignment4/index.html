            The Ocean (also the Sea or the world Ocean) is the body of salt
            water that covers approximately 70.8% of the surface of Earth and
            contains 97% of Earth's water. An Ocean can also refer to any of the
            large bodies of water into which the world Ocean is conventionally
            divided. Separate names are used to identify five different areas of
            the Ocean: Pacific (the largest), Atlantic, Indian, Southern
            (Antarctic), and Arctic (the smallest). Sea water covers
            approximately 361,000,000 km2 (139,000,000 sq mi) of the planet. The
            Ocean is the principal component of Earth's hydrosphere, and
            therefore integral to life on Earth. Acting as a huge heat
            reservoir, the Ocean influences climate and weather patterns, the
            carbon cycle, and the water cycle.<br />
            Oceanographers divide the Ocean into different vertical and
            horizontal zones based on physical and biological conditions. The
            pelagic zone consists of the water column from surface to Ocean
            floor throughout the open Ocean. The water column is further
            categorized in other zones depending on depth and on how much light
            is present. The photic zone includes water from the surface to a
            depth of 1% of the surface light (about 200 m in the open Ocean),
            where photosynthesis can occur. This makes the photic zone the most
            biodiverse. Photosynthesis by plants and microscopic algae (free
            floating phytoplankton) creates organic matter using light, water,
            carbon dioxide, and nutrients. Ocean photosynthesis creates 50% of
            the oxygen in earth's atmosphere. This upper sunlit zone is the
            origin of the food supply which sustains most of the Ocean
            ecosystem. Light only penetrates to a depth of a few hundred meters;
            the remaining Ocean below is cold and dark. The continental shelf
            where the Ocean approaches dry land is more shallow, with a depth of
            a few hundred meters or less. Human activity has a greater impact on
            the continental shelf.

          <p>
            The terms "the Ocean" or "the Sea " used without specification refer
            to the interconnected body of salt water covering the majority of
            the Earth's surface. It includes the Atlantic, Pacific, Indian,
            Southern and Arctic Oceans. As a general term, "the Ocean" and "the
            Sea " are often interchangeable, although speakers of British
            English refer to "the Sea " in all cases, even when the body of
            water is one of the Oceans.<br />
            Strictly speaking, a "Sea " is a body of water (generally a division
            of the world Ocean) partly or fully enclosed by land. The word "Sea
            " can also be used for many specific, much smaller bodies of Sea
            water, such as the North Sea or the Red Sea . There is no sharp
            distinction between Sea s and Oceans, though generally Sea s are
            smaller, and are often partly (as marginal Sea s) or wholly (as
            inland Sea s) bordered by land.

        <p>
          The contemporary concept of the World Ocean was coined in the early
          20th century by the Russian Oceanographer Yuly Shokalsky to refer to
          the continuous Ocean that covers and encircles most of Earth. The
          global, interconnected body of salt water is sometimes referred to as
          the world Ocean or global Ocean. The concept of a continuous body of
          water with relatively free interchange among its parts is of
          fundamental importance to Oceanography.

              The word Ocean comes from the figure in classical antiquity,
              Oceanus the elder of the Titans in classical Greek mythology.
              Oceanus was believed by the ancient Greeks and Romans to be the
              divine personification of an enormous river encircling the
              world.<br />
              The concept of has an Indo-European connection. Greek has been
              compared to the Vedic predicated of the dragon who captured the
              cows/rivers. Related to this notion, the Okeanos is represented
              with a dragon-tail on some early Greek vases.
