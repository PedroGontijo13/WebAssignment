            Spider-Man is a superhero appearing in American comic books
            published by Marvel Comics. Created by writer-editor Stan Lee and
            artist Steve Ditko, he first appeared in the anthology comic book
            Amazing Fantasy #15 (August 1962) in the Silver Age of Comic Books.
            He has since been featured in films, television shows, video games,
            and plays. Spider-Man is the alias of Peter Parker, an orphan raised
            by his Aunt May and Uncle Ben in New York City after his parents
            Richard and Mary Parker died in a plane crash. Lee and Ditko had the
            character deal with the struggles of adolescence and financial
            issues and gave him many supporting characters, such as Flash
            Thompson, J. Jonah Jameson, and Harry Osborn; romantic interests
            Gwen Stacy, Mary Jane Watson, and the Black Cat; and foes such as
            Doctor Octopus, the Green Goblin, and Venom. In his origin story, he
            gets spider-related abilities from a bite from a radioactive spider;
            these include clinging to surfaces, superhuman strength and agility,
            and detecting danger with his "spider-sense."

            n 1962, with the success of the Fantastic Four, Marvel Comics editor
            and head writer Stan Lee was casting about for a new superhero idea.
            He said the idea for Spider-Man arose from a surge in teenage demand
            for comic books, and the desire to create a character with whom
            teens could identify.  As with Fantastic Four, Lee saw Spider-Man as
            an opportunity to "get out of his system" what he felt was missing
            in comic books.

            In his autobiography, Lee cites the non-superhuman pulp magazine
            crime fighter the Spider as a great influenceand in a multitude of
            print and video interviews, Lee stated he was further inspired by
            seeing a spider climb up a wall—adding in his autobiography that he
            has told that story so often he has become unsure of whether or not
            this is true.Although at the time teenage superheroes were usually
            given names ending with "boy", Lee says he chose "Spider-Man"
            because he wanted the character to age as the series progressed, and
            moreover felt the name "Spider-Boy" would have made the character
            sound inferior to other superheroes. He also decided to insert a
            hyphen in the name, as he felt it looked too similar to Superman,
            another superhero with a red and blue costume which starts with an
            "S" and ends with "man" .

            Sally Kempton for the Village Voice opined in 1965 that "Spider-Man
            has a terrible identity problem, a marked inferiority complex, and a
            fear of women. He is anti-social, [sic] castration-ridden, racked
            with Oedipal guilt, and accident-prone ... [a] functioning
            neurotic".Agonizing over his choices, always attempting to do right,
            he is nonetheless viewed with suspicion by the authorities, who seem
            unsure as to whether he is a helpful vigilante or a clever criminal.
            Notes cultural historian Bradford W. Wright,

            Spider-Man's plight was to be misunderstood and persecuted by the
            very public that he swore to protect. In the first issue of The
            Amazing Spider-Man, J. Jonah Jameson, publisher of the Daily Bugle,
            launches an editorial campaign against the "Spider-Man menace." The
            resulting negative publicity exacerbates popular suspicions about
            the mysterious Spider-Man and makes it impossible for him to earn
            any more money by performing. Eventually, the bad press leads the
            authorities to brand him an outlaw. Ironically, Peter finally lands
            a job as a photographer for Jameson's Daily Bugle.

            The mid-1960s stories reflect the political tensions of the time.

            From his high-school beginnings to his entry into college life,
            Spider-Man remained the superhero most relevant to the world of
            young people. Fittingly, then, his comic book also contained some of
            the earliest references to the politics of young people. In 1968, in
            the wake of actual militant student demonstrations at Columbia
            University, Peter Parker finds himself in the midst of similar
            unrest at his Empire State University.... Peter has to reconcile his
            natural sympathy for the students with his assumed obligation to
            combat lawlessness as Spider-Man. As a law-upholding liberal, he
            finds himself caught between militant leftism and angry
            conservatives.

              Peter Parker has superhuman spider-powers and abilities derived
              from mutations resulting from the bite of a radioactive
              spider.Since the original Lee-Ditko stories, Spider-Man has had
              the ability to cling to walls. This has been speculated to be
              based on a distance-dependent interaction between his body and
              surfaces, known as the van der Waals force,though in the 2002
              Spider-Man film, his hands and feet are lined with tiny clinging
              cilia in t he manner of a real spider's feet. Spider-Man's other
              powers include superhuman strength, speed, agility and balance,
              and a precognitive sixth sense referred to as his "Spider-Sense,"
              which alerts him to danger. Spider-Man has a healing factor that
              allows him to recover from injuries sustained during battle.In the
              aftermath of the 1989 "Acts of Vengeance" storyline, Spider-Man
              was said to have "superhuman recuperative abilities" that sped up
              his recovery from the exhaustion he suffered in defeating the
              Tri-Sentinel. The character was originally conceived by Stan Lee
              and Steve Ditko as intellectually gifted, but later writers have
              depicted his intellect at genius level. After years of fighting,
              Parker honed his skill into an equivalent of martial arts that is
              unique to his powers. Academically brilliant, Parker has expertise
              in the fields of applied science, chemistry, physics, biology,
              engineering, mathematics, and mechanics.

            Main articles: List of Spider-Man supporting characters and List of
            incarnations of Spider-Man Spider-Man has had a wide range of
            connected characters during his inception. A variant cover art of
            The Amazing Spider-Man #1 depicts the heads of various Spider-Man
            enemies behind Spider-Man (as drawn by Kevin Maguire) as shown in
            the center. Spider-Man has had a large range of supporting
            characters introduced in the comics that are essential in the issues
            and storylines that star him. After his parents died, Peter Parker
            was raised by his loving aunt, May Parker, and his uncle and father
            figure, Ben Parker. After Uncle Ben is murdered by a burglar, Aunt
            May is virtually Peter's only family, and she and Peter are very
            close. J. Jonah Jameson is the publisher of the Daily Bugle and
            Peter Parker's boss. A harsh critic of Spider-Man, he constantly
            features negative articles about the superhero in his newspaper.
            Despite his role as Jameson's editor and confidant, Robbie Robertson
            is always depicted as a supporter of both Peter Parker and
            Spider-Man.
