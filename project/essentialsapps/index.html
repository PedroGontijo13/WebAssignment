          I have never shared my suite of essential apps before, so here it is.
          As I have multiple devices running different operating
          systems(Android, iOS, macOS, Windows), I give a first priority to apps
          with cross-platform support.

        <div class="item_explain">
          <p>
            <span class="green_line">Google Keep:</span> For quick notes,
            shopping lists for the day, and short notes I want to keep handy. It
            employs Material You design which looks nice on my Pixel 5. My notes
            are synchronised and accessible on all my devices.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span class="green_line">Notability:</span> For written notes,
            scribbles, language learning, meeting notes. My notes are backed up
            to Google Drive.The only downside is that the app is available only
            on iOS and macOS.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span class="green_line">Notion:</span> For serious notes, travel
            plans, wikis, learning, notes that need text formatting. Notion is
            very powerful at being a database and creating interactive notes. I
            can also collaborate with friends when planning a trip.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span class="green_line">Standard Notes:</span> For plain text
            notes. I like the simplicity and the sense of privacy and security
            that Standard Notes offers. Notes are encrypted end-to-end and you
            can also lock the app with different passcodes on each device. More
            features can be added (on paid plans) through extensions.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span class="green_line">TickTick:</span> For to-do lists. I can
            organise tasks into lists, assign a priority, repeat occurrences,
            add tags, add subtasks, and do habit checks. The app is simple,
            lightweight, and works fast on all my devices.
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="communication">
        <div class="item_title">
          <h2>Communication</h2>
        </div>
        <div class="item_image">
          <img src="./assets/Communication.png" alt="Communication images" />
        </div>
        <div class="item_explain">
          <p>
            <span class="green_line">Edison Mail:</span> An email client on my
            iPad. I just like the design.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span class="green_line">Gmail:</span> It comes with my phone and it
            works well so I don’t want to download anything else and keep two
            email apps on my phone.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span class="green_line">LINE:</span> For messaging family and high
            school friends. I don’t really want to use it because the app is big
            and bloated, but it has been well embodied in Thai culture since
            many businesses and government services offer their communication
            and membership channels there.
          </p>
          <p><span class="green_line">Slack:</span> My company uses this.</p>
          <p>
            <span class="green_line">Telegram:</span> For messaging friends. I
            can tell you this is the BEST messaging app. It is lightweight and
            crazy fast on all my devices. It has creative and useful features I
            and my friends actually use and love. The app is simple and
            interactions feel natural.

      <div class="web_browsing">

        <div class="item_explain">
          <p>
            <span class="green_line">DuckDuckGo Browser:</span> I don’t want to
            be tracked. The good things are random private emails and tracking
            prevention. The downside as of this writing is that the desktop
            version doesn’t support extensions so I have to manually open
            1Password, search for credentials and click autofill. Having no
            extensions means I have to organise my bookmarks manually too (with
            Raindrop).
          </p>
          <p>
            <span class="green_line">Raindrop.io:</span> For saving links. I can
            organise my links with tags and folders.

        <div class="item_explain">
          <p>
            <span class="green_line">1Password:</span> For storing and
            generating credentials. The user interface is clean and feels
            welcoming. It can store OTP’s and automatically fill them (but I
            don’t use that feature). It can check if your passwords have
            appeared in breaches, or are reused on multiple services. It can
            store many kinds of credentials other than passwords: SSH keys,
            notes, identities, etc. Browser extensions work quite fast too.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span class="green_line">Aegis:</span> For storing OTP’s. It is
            simple, fast and lightweight. I can backup the vault—encrypted—so I
            don’t have to reconfigure 2FA on all services when I change my
            phone. I wanted to use 1Password for storing OTP’s because it would
            automatically fill them, but what’s the purpose of two-factor
            authentication, then?

                those separate apps.

                easy to find new appliances that are compatible in the
                ecosystem.
